# FPTsDCs_tool
This is a tool to numerically analyze first passage time properties of diffusion with a stochastic diffusion coefficient.
A diffusion coefficient is simulated by a two-state Markov process. 

## Requirements
MATLAB version 9.9 (R2020b) or later versions

## Usage
 - run Hvardept.m for calculating the time dependence of the variance of the normalized stochastic diffusion coefficient. 
 - run markovpppO.m for calculating the cumulative probability of early arriving particles.  
 - run markovtheoreticalFPTDO.m for evaluating first passage time distribution based on theoretical equations. 
 - run markovsimDxfptO.m for estimating first passage times based on simulation.
